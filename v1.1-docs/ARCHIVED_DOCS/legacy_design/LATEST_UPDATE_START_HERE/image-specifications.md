## Technical Implementation Notes

### **Accent Color Overlays (CSS)**

All accent colors are applied via CSS, NOT baked into images. This allows:
- Faster image loading (no color processing)
- Easy color adjustments without re-exporting images
- Cleaner grayscale source images

**Example CSS:**
```css
.section-featured {
  background-image: url('workspace-photo.jpg');
  background-color: #FFFFFF;
  position: relative;
}

.section-featured::before {
  content: '';
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(255, 107, 53, 0.08) 0%, transparent 100%);
  pointer-events: none;
}
```

### **Image Optimization**

- **Mobile:** 200KB max per image
- **Desktop:** 300KB max per image
- **Format:** JPEG primary, WebP fallback
- **Lazy-loading:** All images except Hero Image 1
- **CDN:** Vercel Image Optimization or Cloudinary

### **Responsive Behavior**

- **Mobile (375px):** 9:16 portrait images, full-bleed
- **Tablet (768px):** Same images, scaled proportionally
- **Desktop (1024px+):** 16:9 landscape images, centered with max-width container
