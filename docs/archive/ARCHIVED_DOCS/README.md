# Suburbmates v1.1 — Archived Documentation

All files in this directory (and its subfolders) are **read-only historical references** that were superseded by the Stage‑3 v3.1 documents listed in the SSOT handbook.

## How to use this folder

- Do **not** edit these files when implementing new work. Find the canonical v3.1 file via the Doc Map (`v1.1-docs/SSOT_DEVELOPMENT_HANDBOOK.md`, Stage 3 Document Map section) and update that file instead.
- When you retire a doc, move it here and add a banner at the top of the archived file noting `Superseded on YYYY-MM-DD → see <new file>`.
- Internal analysis, spreadsheet exports, and Copilot/AI scratch pads belong under `ARCHIVED_DOCS/internal_analysis/`.
